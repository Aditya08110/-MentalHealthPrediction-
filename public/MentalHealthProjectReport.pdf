- Features include user demographics, self-reported scores, and activity trends.
- Model is trained and evaluated using cross-validation.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score for classification tasks.
- ROC-AUC for risk prediction.
- Regular monitoring for model drift and bias.

**Ethical Considerations:**
- All predictions are for educational and supportive purposes only.
- Users are encouraged to consult mental health professionals for any concerns.
- Data is anonymized and not shared with third parties.
